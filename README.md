Title:

	2D Platformer

Description:

	2D platform game developed in unity.

Vision Statement:

	Make a 2D platform game that is fun to play. 

Motivation:

	To learn about 2D game development.

Risks:
	
	Little to no experience with non programming assets.
	No prior experience with working with people in the team.
	This is a new working environment (Unity and C#)

Mitigation Strategy:

	We can bring outside people/assets to help with non programming parts.
	
	Spend time with each other programming.
	
	We would use unity/C# tutorials to lean the new environment. 


Requirements:

	User Requirements:
		As a user I want to progress through levels so I can complete the game. (1)
		As a user I want moving platforms so that jump timing provides an added challenge. (5)
		As a user I want enemies to kill so that I can get satisfaction from defeating an enemy. (3) 
		As a user I want a high level of challenge so that completing a level provides a sense of accomplishment. (8)
	Functional Requirements:
		As a user I want the game to run without any major bugs so I don't have to worry about mid-game crashes (3)
	Non-Functional Requirements:
		As a user I want a game that runs smoothly at high FPS so I don't die due to latency issues. (5)
		
Methodology:

	Agile
